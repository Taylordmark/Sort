SORT
=====

A simple online and realtime tracking algorithm for 2D multiple object tracking in video sequences.

### Introduction

SORT is a barebones implementation of a visual multiple object tracking framework based on rudimentary data association and state estimation techniques. It is designed for online tracking applications where only past and current frames are available and the method produces object identities on the fly. While this minimalistic tracker doesn't handle occlusion or re-entering objects its purpose is to serve as a baseline and testbed for the development of future trackers.


### Using SORT in your own project

Below is the gist of how to instantiate and update SORT. See the ['__main__'](https://github.com/abewley/sort/blob/master/sort.py#L239) section of [sort.py](https://github.com/abewley/sort/blob/master/sort.py#L239) for a complete example.
    
    from sort import *
    
    #create instance of SORT
    mot_tracker = Sort() 
    
    # get detections
    ...
    
    # update SORT
    track_bbs_ids = mot_tracker.update(detections)

    # track_bbs_ids is a np array where each row contains a valid bounding box and track_id (last column)
    ...
    
 ### Current application
 Use get_folder_image_detections.py on a folder of images. The program will load model, detect all objects in frames, save as a dictionary to a .txt file. Then data can be passed to SORT (still in progress in the markham_detect_and_sort.py file) by selecting frame index from dict to retrieve data.

 Then .py files A_probability from pdfs.py and B_probability from dists.py can be used to return a new predicted class using Naive Bayes probabilities.
