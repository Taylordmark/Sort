SORT
=====

A simple online and realtime tracking algorithm for 2D multiple object tracking in video sequences.

### Introduction

SORT is a barebones implementation of a visual multiple object tracking framework based on rudimentary data association and state estimation techniques. It is designed for online tracking applications where only past and current frames are available and the method produces object identities on the fly. While this minimalistic tracker doesn't handle occlusion or re-entering objects its purpose is to serve as a baseline and testbed for the development of future trackers.


### Using SORT in your own project

Below is the gist of how to instantiate and update SORT. See the ['__main__'](https://github.com/abewley/sort/blob/master/sort.py#L239) section of [sort.py](https://github.com/abewley/sort/blob/master/sort.py#L239) for a complete example.
    
    from sort import *
    
    #create instance of SORT
    mot_tracker = Sort() 
    
    # get detections
    ...
    
    # update SORT
    track_bbs_ids = mot_tracker.update(detections)

    # track_bbs_ids is a np array where each row contains a valid bounding box and track_id (last column)
    ...
